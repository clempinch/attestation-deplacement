# Generator of "Attestation de deplacement derogatoire"

This webapp generates "attestation de deplacement derogatoire" with a simple button, one for each reason.

User info is stored in the local storage of the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a fork of the official [Générateur de certificat de déplacement](https://github.com/LAB-MI/attestation-deplacement-derogatoire-q4-2020) project.

It uses:

- [PDF-LIB](https://pdf-lib.js.org/)
